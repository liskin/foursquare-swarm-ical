## Installation

Using [pipx][]:

```
pipx ensurepath
pipx install foursquare-swarm-ical
```

To keep a local git clone around:

```
git clone https://github.com/liskin/foursquare-swarm-ical
make -C foursquare-swarm-ical pipx
```

Alternatively, if you don't need the isolated virtualenv that [pipx][]
provides, feel free to just:

```
pip install foursquare-swarm-ical
```

[pipx]: https://github.com/pypa/pipx

## Setup and usage

* Obtain a Foursquare API Access Token. The easiest way to obtain one is to
  use their [API Exporer](https://foursquare.com/developers/explore/). Grant
  it permission for your account, open DevTools, let it execute an API call
  and then inspect the request and copy `oauth_token` from the Query String
  Parameters.

  * Chrome: <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference#payload-encodings>
  * Firefox: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor/request_list>

* Run `foursquare-swarm-ical`:

  ```
  $ foursquare-swarm-ical --access-token TOKENTOKENTOKEN --max-size 1M -o swarm-checkins.ical
  ```

* Import `swarm-checkins.ical` into your calendar app of choice.

  (Note that Google Calendar refreshes iCal URLs once a day and cannot be
  tweaked in any way. Manual refresh isn't possible either.)

## Configuration file

Access token (and other options) can be set permanently in a config file,
which is located at `~/.config/foursquare_swarm_ical/config.yaml` by default
(on Linux; on other platforms see output of `--help`).

Sample config file can be generated using the `--config-sample` flag:

<!-- include tests/readme/config-sample.md -->
    $ foursquare-swarm-ical --config-sample
    # Be more verbose
    verbose: 0
    
    # Sync again or just use local database?
    sync: true
    
    # Foursquare oauth2 access token
    access_token: TEXT
    
    # SQLite database file
    database: /home/user/.local/share/foursquare_swarm_ical/checkins.sqlite
    
    # Prefix summary with venue category as emoji
    emoji: true
    
    # Output file
    output: '-'
    
    # Maximum size of the output file in bytes (accepts K and M suffixes as well)
    max_size: SIZE
